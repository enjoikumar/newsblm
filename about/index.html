Joshua will be successful in 1st grade." His teacher's words were prophetic. Josh is a true authority in mixed-use development, in creating complex and iconic projects. With a unique ability to skillfully hand draw concepts, he creates intricate development solutions, rapidly adapting to clients' needs and visions. As the founding Partner of SBLM, since 1993, Josh has been designing environments where people want to spend time and that reflect both the developer's vision and the dynamics of culture and community.</p>
